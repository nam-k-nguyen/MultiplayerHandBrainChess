## Project Focus 

This project will focus on the development of the Hand-and-Brain Chess application.  

### What is Hand-and-Brain chess? 

Hand-and-Brain is a variant of the famous Chess game. For this variant, each game will be joined by 4 players, split into 2 teams. Each team will have a Hand player and a Brain player. Each turn, the Brain player will tell the Hand player which pieces to play, but not the position of that piece, nor where to move that piece. The Hand player will have to determine which piece to move and where to move it by themselves.  

### What is the technical scope of this project? 

This project will utilize front-end frameworks such as React.js, Vue.js, Next.js, or Svelte. 

This project will implement back-end using Node.js based libraries/frameworks such as Express.js and Nest JS. 

The project will be hosted on GitHub and deployed on Render.io. 

The chess engines for this project will be implemented using external libraries. 

### Main functionalities 

The Hand-and-Brain chess app will allow users to play against each other in real-time. There are 4 modes, distinct from each other by number of players and whether the players are AI or not 

_Single player_

- Mode 1: Normal chess, player vs AI (1 player) 
- Mode 2: H & B chess, Hand player + Brain AI vs. AI (1 player) 

_Multiplayer_

- Mode 3: Normal chess, player vs player (2 players) 
- Mode 4: H & B chess, Hand AI + Brain player vs. Hand AI + Brain player (2 players) 
- Mode 5: H & B chess, Hand player + Brain AI vs. Hand Player + Brain AI (2 players) 
- Mode 6: H & B chess, Hand player + Brain player vs. Hand Player + Brain player (4 players)
