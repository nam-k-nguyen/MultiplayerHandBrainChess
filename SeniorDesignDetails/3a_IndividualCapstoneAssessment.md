# Individual Capstone Assessment

## Introduction about what senior design projects is all about from your individual academic perspective 

To me, senior design projects are skill indicators. They highlight the depth of your learning experience throughout college. A good senior design project will help strengthen your resume. In addition, the development process will help students gain valuable practical experience in design and engineering. This also includes the process of building, prototyping, testing, and refining, which is often found in the development process of physical and software products. Furthermore, senior design projects also incorporate project management skills to oversee the project’s effectiveness and make sure it does not halt. Finally, senior design projects act as a portal to condense and demonstrate the accumulated knowledge of the students. 

## How your collective experiences will guide the development of your project 

The development of this project relies on the experience and knowledge I acquired during college. Which consists of 2 main sources:  

First are the academic courses which I have taken at UC. The course CS2080C – Data Structures will help me use the correct data structure for the right task. This is extremely important since correct implementation will lead to faster runtime and lower storage consumption. In addition, the CS2021 – Python Programming course provides good programming conventions and patterns. It is a crucial part as it makes the code more maintainable and readable, thus making the development process faster and more efficient. Lastly, the CS3003 - Programming Languages course provides me with sufficient knowledge to pick the correct language for my tech stack and implement the correct paradigm in my code. 

Second are the experiences I gained during my CO-OP semester. During my first internship with EyeQ Tech, I worked as a full-stack web developer. My work at this company teaches me a lot about producing multiple options to accomplish software objectives. I also learned the resolution to follow through all the way with a project despite being able to drop it. To accommodate the technical requirements of the projects that I had to work on, I also learned to research and read documentations. These skills will enable me to effectively create a plan for the senior design project, to adopt modern technologies, and adjust my solutions when needed. Finally, the technical skills I have learned are React, Node, Express, Nest JS, Mongo DB Atlas, and Socket.io. Socket.io will be useful to implement the multiplayer aspects of the application. I will use Nest JS or Express for backend and React or Next JS (haven’t learned yet) for frontend. 

## Your motivation for the project and preliminary project approach  

Chess has long been one of my favorite games to play. One of its few constraints, however, is the number of players who can participate. Hand-and-brain is a healthy and original extension of chess. It does not change the rules, but simply adds a framework which allows 4 players to join instead of one. Despite how fun this mode is, I have not been able to find a multiplayer implementation of Hand-and-Brain chess (there is a single-player version by “vitomd,” feel free to check it out!). Therefore, for my senior design project, I would like to develop multiplayer Hand-and-Brain chess. 

My preliminary approach to developing Hand-and-Brain chess is to first do research. I will investigate potential libraries for implementing a chess engine and a chess AI, ideally NPM packages. I will follow up with familiarizing myself with Next.js, since it is an extension of React, which I am familiar with. In addition, Next.js provides flexible options to blend frontend and backend. After getting used to Next.js, I will review Socket.io, and look for greater options if possible. I will then do further research if needed, visualize the individual components into the bigger picture, and finally, start programming. 

Discuss what your expected results and accomplishments will be. Discuss how you will self-evaluate your contributions: how will you know when you are done and if you have done a good job?  

The result of this project should be a fully deployed website that implements the main functionalities, introduced in the Project Focus section of the Team Contract document. To assess the progress of the project, multiple milestones will be set in future documents. Some milestones are: 

- Create a Next.js application 
- Implement a multiplayer system with socket 
- Render a playable chess board  
- Deploy the application 
- Allow players to play normal 1v1 chess 
- Incrementally enable all 6 modes of the game
